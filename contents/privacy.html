</header>

<p>
This privacy policy covers how niteLite.io will treat all information
received from visitors. The policy is really simple.
</p>

<p>
The only personal information this site may have on you is anything you
voluntarily disclose.
</p>

<p>
niteLite.io does record information from your browser.  This data includes
cookie information, IP address, and the page requested. This information is
used to track anonymous analytics information through my own systems.
niteLite.io also uses Google Analytics to generate anonymous statistics of
visits, clicks, etc.
</p>

<p>
This information is kept private. It is not shared with anyone.
</p>

<p>
If I make any changes to the privacy policy, the changes will be published
here.
