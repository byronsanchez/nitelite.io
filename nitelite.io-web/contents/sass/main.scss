// This is the entry point to the sass files

// The reason we're using this main file instead of just having the javascript main file call out to lib and app
// itself is because in doing that, lib variables and imports get isolated from app variables and imports
//
// By using this main.scss file, we can import /this/ file in the main.coffee file, and have any variables, settings,
// and mixins imported in lib.scss be accessible to app.scss without code duplication.

@import "lib";
@import "app";
@import "print";
